# ML Engineering: From First Principles to Production

**Transforming Industries Through Technology for 35 Years | Now Building ML/AI Systems**

I'm Brad Hurlbert, Solutions Architect at Sprouts Farmers Market. My career has been about bringing discipline and innovation to industries at inflection points—from helping the auto industry compete with Japan through project management transformation, to building enterprise systems that scale. Now I'm building production ML/AI capabilities to architect the next generation of intelligent systems.

## 💼 Career Journey

**Early Career: Discipline Meets Innovation**
- Started in Accounting Information Systems
- Mentored by Bechtel Corporation engineers who saw potential in combining finance acumen with engineering discipline
- Spent 13 years in the auto industry working with executive teams to establish project management practices
- Helped American automakers compete with Japanese manufacturing excellence through organizational transformation

**Evolution: From Process to Technology**
- Founded Hurlbert Consulting Group - 9 years as principal technical advisor
- Led VC-backed fulfillment business (P&L ownership, scaling operations)
- Pentagon software development (mission-critical, secure systems)
- Enterprise software engineering and architecture across multiple industries

**Current: Solutions Architecture at Scale**
- Solutions Architect at Sprouts Farmers Market (grocery retail, 400+ stores, $7B+ revenue)
- Designing cloud-native solutions on Azure
- Bridging business strategy with technical execution
- Enterprise system integration for retail operations

**Now: ML/AI Engineering**
- Author: "AI for Beginners: Using Artificial Intelligence for Good" (UME Publishing, 2023)
- Building production ML systems from first principles
- Applying 35 years of architectural thinking to intelligent systems

## 🎯 Why ML/AI?

I've spent my career at the intersection of business transformation and technology:
- 1980s-90s: Helped auto industry adopt project management discipline
- 2000s: Built enterprise content management and workflow systems
- 2010s: Led cloud transformation and microservices architecture
- 2020s: AI is the next fundamental shift

Rather than just architect systems that use AI, I'm building the capability to design AI systems from the ground up.

## 🧠 What I Bring to ML/AI

**Business & Organizational Expertise:**
- 13 years working with C-suite executives on transformation initiatives
- Understand how to translate business requirements into technical solutions
- P&L ownership and ROI thinking (VC-backed business experience)
- Change management and organizational adoption

**Technical Foundation:**
- 35+ years production software development
- Enterprise architecture and system design at scale
- Cloud-native solutions (Azure, Kubernetes, microservices)
- Security, compliance, governance (Pentagon-level requirements)
- DevOps, CI/CD, monitoring, production operations

**Domain Knowledge:**
- Retail operations and supply chain (current: Sprouts)
- Manufacturing and project management (auto industry)
- Financial systems (accounting background)
- Content management and workflow automation

**What Makes This Different:**
Most ML engineers are strong on models but lack:
- Executive communication and stakeholder management
- Business process understanding and transformation experience  
- Production software and enterprise architecture expertise
- Cross-industry perspective and pattern recognition

I'm not becoming an ML engineer. I'm becoming an ML/AI architect who can design intelligent systems that actually get adopted and create business value.

## 📚 ML Learning Path

Building from neural network fundamentals to production MLOps:

- ✅ **Weeks 1-2:** Python fundamentals
- 🔄 **Weeks 3-4:** Neural networks from scratch (understanding backpropagation)
- ⏳ **Weeks 5-6:** PyTorch and deep learning architectures
- ⏳ **Weeks 7-8:** Transformers and RAG systems
- ⏳ **Weeks 9-12:** MLOps and production deployment

## 🚀 Projects (Building in Public)

**Foundational Understanding:**
- Neural Network from Scratch - NumPy implementation, backpropagation from first principles
- PyTorch Deep Learning - CNNs, RNNs, Transformers
- Understanding what's under the hood before using frameworks

**Applied Retail ML:**
- Demand Forecasting System - Time series for inventory optimization
- Recommendation Engine - Collaborative filtering with business impact metrics
- Computer Vision - Product detection and shelf monitoring

**Production ML Systems:**
- RAG System for Enterprise SOPs - Knowledge retrieval for retail operations
- MLOps Infrastructure - Docker, Kubernetes, monitoring, CI/CD
- Model Deployment - FastAPI services, Azure ML integration
- Cost optimization and scalability analysis

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**ML/AI:** Python | PyTorch | HuggingFace Transformers | LangChain | scikit-learn | NumPy | Pandas

**Production:** FastAPI | Docker | Kubernetes | Azure ML | MLflow | REST APIs | Monitoring

**Foundation:** C# | .NET Core | Azure | SQL Server | Microservices | CI/CD | Enterprise Architecture

**Certifications:** Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals

## 📖 Philosophy

**First Principles Thinking:**
- Understand fundamentals before frameworks
- Know what's under the hood to make better architectural decisions
- Build from scratch, then use tools intelligently

**Production-Ready Systems:**
- Notebooks are experiments, not deliverables
- Focus on deployment, monitoring, governance, cost
- Systems must integrate with existing enterprise architecture

**Business Impact:**
- ML must solve real problems with measurable ROI
- Technology serves business objectives, not the reverse
- Adoption matters as much as accuracy

**Continuous Evolution:**
- 35 years taught me: stay ahead by rebuilding skills from scratch
- Learning in public, helping others on this journey
- The best time to reinvent yourself is always now

*Started: February 2026 | Current: Week 1 - Python Fundamentals*

*"After helping transform the auto industry, building enterprise systems, and founding companies, I've learned: the best way to architect the future is to build it yourself. ML/AI is the next transformation."*

## **Your Revised LinkedIn Post (Week 1):**
```
In the 1980s, I was mentored by two Bechtel Corporation engineers who taught me to bring project management discipline to the auto industry. For 13 years, I worked with executive teams at American automakers, helping them compete with Japan's manufacturing excellence.

That experience taught me: when industries transform, you need people who understand both the business problem AND the technical solution.

35 years later, I'm doing it again.

AI is fundamentally reshaping enterprise systems. Rather than just talk about it at the architecture level, I'm building ML/AI capabilities from the ground up.

Week 1 complete: Python fundamentals.

Coming from C# and 35 years of enterprise development, the shift to Python isn't about syntax—it's about philosophy. Dynamic typing, duck typing, first-class functions. Different design patterns, different thinking.

Next up: Building a neural network from scratch in NumPy. No frameworks. I need to understand backpropagation at the matrix level before I architect ML systems at scale.

The goal isn't to become a research scientist. It's to combine:
- 13 years of executive-level organizational transformation
- 35 years of production software architecture
- Deep understanding of ML fundamentals and production deployment

Industries transform when technology meets business discipline. That's what I did in auto. That's what I'll do with AI.
