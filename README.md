# ML Engineering: From First Principles to Production

**Solutions Architect → ML/AI Engineer | 35 Years of Staying Ahead of the Curve**

I'm Brad Hurlbert, Solutions Architect at Sprouts Farmers Market. Over 35 years, I've consistently reinvented myself to stay at the forefront of technology—from accounting systems and OCR/imaging platforms to enterprise cloud architecture. Now I'm building production ML/AI capabilities from the ground up.

## 🎯 Why ML/AI?

I've architected enterprise systems my entire career. AI is transforming how those systems work. Rather than just talk about it, I'm building it—learning from first principles through production deployment.

## 💼 Background

**Current:** Solutions Architect at Sprouts Farmers Market (grocery retail, 400+ stores, $7B+ revenue)
- Designing cloud-native solutions on Azure
- Bridging business requirements with technical architecture
- Enterprise system integration at scale

**Experience Highlights:**
- 35+ years software engineering, architecture, consulting
- Founded Hurlbert Consulting Group (9 years)
- Led VC-backed fulfillment business
- Pentagon software development (mission-critical systems)
- Sr. Software Engineer roles at CUNA Mutual, enChoice, FileTrail
- Author: "AI for Beginners: Using Artificial Intelligence for Good"
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals

**Technical DNA:**
- Enterprise architecture and system design
- Cloud-native solutions (Azure, Kubernetes, microservices)
- Full-stack development (C#, .NET Core, REST APIs, SQL Server)
- DevOps/CI/CD, containerization, monitoring
- SAML/OAuth2, security, compliance
- Agile/Scrum leadership

## 📚 ML Learning Path

Building deep understanding from neural networks to MLOps:

- ✅ **Weeks 1-2:** Python fundamentals
- 🔄 **Weeks 3-4:** Neural networks from scratch (NumPy implementation)
- ⏳ **Weeks 5-6:** PyTorch and deep learning
- ⏳ **Weeks 7-8:** Transformers and RAG systems
- ⏳ **Weeks 9-12:** MLOps and production deployment

## 🚀 Projects (Building Now)

**Fundamentals:**
- Neural Network from Scratch - Understanding backpropagation deeply
- PyTorch implementations - CNNs, transformers, practical models

**Applied Retail ML:**
- Demand Forecasting System - Time series for inventory optimization
- Recommendation Engine - Collaborative filtering with business metrics
- Computer Vision - Product detection and shelf monitoring

**Production Focus:**
- RAG System for Enterprise SOPs - Knowledge retrieval for retail operations
- MLOps Infrastructure - Docker, monitoring, CI/CD for ML
- Model Deployment - FastAPI services with Azure integration

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**ML/AI:** Python | PyTorch | HuggingFace Transformers | LangChain | scikit-learn | NumPy | Pandas

**Deployment:** FastAPI | Docker | Kubernetes | Azure ML | MLflow | REST APIs

**Foundation:** C# | .NET Core | Azure | SQL Server | Microservices | CI/CD

## 📖 Philosophy

- **First principles:** Understand what's under the hood before using frameworks
- **Production-ready:** Build deployable systems, not just notebooks
- **Business impact:** ML must solve real problems with measurable ROI
- **Learning in public:** Share the journey, help others following this path

## 🎓 Why This Matters

Most ML engineers are strong on models but weak on:
- Enterprise architecture and system integration
- Production deployment and monitoring
- Business requirements translation
- Security, compliance, governance
- Cost optimization at scale

I bring 35+ years of production software experience to ML/AI. That's the differentiator.
